title: "Third Enhancement"

This third and final enhancement is that of a bit of a personal project that I wanted to make within this capstone course to try and encapsulate a lot of the skills and abilities that I have gained throughout the entire program. My goal was to create a web based application to track my friends and I's current standings within our tag rounds of disc golf. This entails playing a normal round of disc golf, but including a numbered tag that is handed out as new players come in with an increasing number. The goal is to try and improve your number throughout the season by beating other players within individual rounds and exchanging tags afterwards. As it currently stands, we have to try and remember where each tag is at any given time. With this app, we would be able to input rounds, and have a leaderboard showing who has which tag, as well as see round results and overall leaderboards.

The code for this project is located in [It's own repository](https://github.com/Jfarquhar33/Disc-Golf-App) though it is missing the node_modules folder as it was giving me issues trying to upload the larger files to github.

The project was built off of Next.js and supabase for the database work. I had actually not worked with either before starting this project, but the process after some initial learning everything went relatively smooth. A bulk of the code is in HTML, with some CSS for styling, and typescript. There are seven endpoints for the user on the website, one for the home page, an admin login page, a leaderboard page, an admin login page, a rounds page, a leftover settings page that I had not implemented fully, a submit round page, and a tags page.

Most of my challenges came from actually learning how to implement the differences of Next and then when I was implementing the database side of it all after I had the groundwork already working. This approach was a little unorthodox, but I believed it made more sense in the structure of the week to week progress put on by the capstone course. This also made sense as I was creating the app through these last two months, leading to a lot of different changes being made throughout the process. My biggest logic issue came through trying to ensure that when a new player was being added, they were getting a new tag. I was getting a lot of errors where users would end up with the same tag, which should not be possible, but after ample breaks and some additional research I was able to get it figured out to my code was assigning tags after the fact, but it made the entire process much easier to just add a tag as soon as there is an instance of a new player and automatically give them the next highest available tag. I was having some issues with the RLS within supabase, but that ultimately came down to my inexperience with it.

Below is the submit-round page.tsx file as it contains a bulk of the logic and functionality of the entire web app. This page handles the updating of the database client, which the other pages then reference to display their information.

I really believe this exerpt really shows off my abilities to utilize multiple tools to bring together a cohesive project. There were many instances of fixing errors that went into this throughout the entire process as this was the culmination of roughly 7 weeks as I got started on it as soon as I saw what we were to do for my capstone project.

title: "First Enhancement"
date: 2025-04-17
---

This first enhancement was for my text based game based in Python for IT-140. The initial iteration was very satisfactory to me, but it was extremely simple, and once a user played the game once, there really was not any reason to continue playing. My main enhancement I wanted to add was to add some sort of replayablity to it. This was initially in the idea of procedural generation, but that proved far too complicated for me, so I settled for a version of randomness that almost gets to procedural generation, but not quite to the point that I would consider it to be.

This game was initially meant to be a text based game where the user would move around the map, collect items, and once they collected every item, they would proceed to the final room to beat the boss and the game. Commands were very straightforward 'go (direction)' or 'get (item)' which made for a very user friendly experience.

This project shows my abilities with Python as well as algorithms and data structures. The enhancements initially took a lot more troubleshooting as I was running into a lot of situations where the rooms were being reassigned or being paired to multiple rooms indicating that they were adjacent, even if they were not.

The code block below showcases the entirety of the code that was this project. This will not be the standard of this portfolio as each project gets exponentially larger, but I thought it was interesting to show off just how small this really is.

```
# Justin Farquhar Project 2
#
# Improvement ideas for capstone project:
#  Adding the option to 'peek' into a room so that the user can see what room is ahead.
#  Have the items spawn in random rooms, and have a chance to spawn in each, probably increasing as the time goes
#  Have the 'map' randomly generate would be amazing, but could see it being difficult to implement properly

# The dictionary links a room to other rooms.
rooms = {
        'Porch': {'East': 'Dining Room'},
        'Dining Room': {'North': 'Living Room', 'East': 'Kitchen', 'West': 'Porch', 'item': 'Laser Pointer'},
        'Living Room': {'North': 'Bedroom', 'South': 'Dining Room', 'item': "Olive's Favorite Ball"},
        'Kitchen': {'North': 'Laundry Room', 'West': 'Dining Room', 'item': 'Couple of Treats'},
        'Laundry Room': {'South': 'Kitchen', 'item': 'Dryer Sheet'},
        'Bedroom': {'West': 'Bathroom', 'East': 'Closet', 'South': 'Living Room', 'item': 'Dinosaur Outfit'},
        'Bathroom': {'East': 'Bedroom', 'item': 'Drink of Water'},
        'Closet': {'West': 'Bedroom', 'item': 'Maintenance Person'}
    }

# start in Porch, and print all the introductory items.
current_room = 'Porch'
inventory = []
print("Welcome to the text based Olive's Great Adventure Game\n""Blueberry has been caught by the Maintenance Person!")
print('Collect all 6 items to save Blueberry and win the game, or be caught by the Maintenance Person')
print("Possible move commands: go North, go South, go East, go West\n" "If you'd like to exit, just type 'exit'")
print("Add to Inventory: get 'item name'\n")
print('You are in the', current_room)
print('Inventory: []')
# initializing a while loop to keep the game going until conditions are met
while current_room != 'Exit' or current_room != 'exit':
    # defining a 'lose' condition and ending the session
    if current_room == 'Closet' and len(inventory) != 6:
        current_room = 'Exit'
        print('The Maintenance Person has caught Olive!')
        print('Thanks for trying the game and feel free to try again!')
        break
    # defining a 'win condition and ending the session
    elif current_room == 'Closet' and len(inventory) == 6:
        print('Congratulations!You were able to collect all of the items and save Blueberry!')
        print('Thanks for playing :)')
        break
    action = input('Enter your move: ')
    action_tokens = action.split()
    # ruling out if input is longer than two words, making it invalid
    if len(action_tokens) > 5:
        print('That is not a valid command!')
    # determining if input is a valid option
    elif action_tokens[0] == 'go':
        # second if clause to determine if its a valid direction
        if action_tokens[1] in rooms[current_room]:
            current_room = rooms[current_room][(action_tokens[1])]
            print('\nYou are in the', current_room)
            print('Inventory: {}'.format(inventory))
            if 'item' in rooms[current_room]:
                room_item = rooms[current_room]['item']
                if room_item not in inventory:
                    print('You see a', room_item)
            print('------------------------')
        # outputting for invalid direction
        else:
            print("You can't go that way!")
    # determining if player is trying to 'get' item
    elif action_tokens[0] == 'get':
        current_item = rooms[current_room]['item']
        # seeing if item typed is in the current room does get slightly redundant restating inventory and current
        # room after picking up the item, but think it is more user-friendly to be reminded.
        if action_tokens[1] in current_item:
            inventory.append(current_item)
            print('You pick up the ', current_item)
            print('------------------------')
            print('You are in the', current_room)
            print('Inventory: {}'.format(inventory))
            print('------------------------')
            # or printing out that it is not
        else:
            print("That's not a valid item")
    # determining if player is trying to leave the game and ending loop
    elif action_tokens[0] == 'exit' or action_tokens[0] == 'Exit':
        current_room = 'Exit'
        print('You have successfully exited.')
        break
    # outputting if move does not include 'go'
    else:
        print("That is not a valid move!")

ending = input('Please type "exit" once you are finished!:')

```

The code block below then showcases the enhancements that were added through this course. A lot of the code has been adjusted as there was a lot of room for improvements, especially when considering simplifying the code. The first 80-90 lines of code show case the map generation that includes the randomness factor to keep the game constantly changing on each playthrough. Other than that, the overall structure remains mostly the same, minus some of the simplification and other smaller enhancements.

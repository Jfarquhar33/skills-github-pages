My name is Justin, I have been in the Computer Science program for just over two years now. I have learned so much more than I could have ever though when I initially applied to the program, including but not limited to python, c++, sql, mysql, secure coding practices, creating 3D graphics, automation qa techniques, generative learning, and much more. The three most important concepts would be secure coding practices, critical thinking/problem solving, and algorithms and data structures.

My current plan for fulfilling the requirements of the capstone as well as building out a portfolio that I am proud of consists of substantially improving my text based game from IT-140, adding some additional functionality to my inventory application from CS-360, and finally beginning development of a web based application to fulfill a personal project.

For the text based game from It-140, I plan to expand upon the application so that the game is able to offer different outcomes and paths each time the user plays the game. In its current state it is an extremely simplistic python app, as it was the very first project that I created within this degree. This will allow me to demonstrate my skills and abilities in algorithms and data structures through implementing a procedurally generated map, rather than the static map that was originally implented in the app. 

For the additional functionality for my inventory application from CS-360, I would like to expand upon the security of the login feature as well as having the databases linked to the specific user that is logged in. In its current state, each user that logs in has access to the same database that is initially created. This worked for the initial iteration, but sort of makes it hard to use if I were to publish it onto an app store. This allows me to expand upon and demonstrate my skills and abilities in databases.

Finally to put a majority of the coursework together and expand some of the web based application work that we did in the few classes in this degree program, I plan to begin development on a personal project. This personal project would help my friend group track what is referred to as a disc golf tag league, where tags are dispersed to each player based on how they scored on the round for the day. While this can be done in person, having the option to keep track of where each tag is, as well as keeping track of a history of the rounds that are played and where players have placed throughout the course of us playing. This would demonstrate my skills and abilities in all three of the key areas of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. Being able to start work on this web application would lead me on the right path to ideally produce a mobile application on each individual app store so that it is much more accessible for each player within our group to view everything. In addition, having the ability to keep track of the history of player rankings would allow me to further delve into the data analysis side of my degree to come to conclusions and insights that could be interesting for the group to see. Being able to implement this will go very far in bridging a gap/weakness in my skillset to where it is hard for me to find something that I want to create and how to start it. I do worry for the timeframe that might be required to implement this as I currently am envisioning, but believe with enough effort I can absolutely make it happen.

### Category Two: Algorithms and Data Structures

### Category Three: Databases



I also plan to implement a much more cohesive portfolio page that much better reflects what I want it to be visually when I have more time to commit to it.
